## I currently don't have a MM so notify me when something is not working. Feel free to send an merge request.

## Alternative
This Module:

Advantage:
- Works with every Python Version

Disadvantage:
- No Pictures of your own car (Always a white ID.3)
- No Location of the Car

[Alternative Module](https://github.com/NikolasRupp/MMM-weconnectid):

Advantage:
- Will use the Pictures provided by the API
- Location of your Car

Disadvantage:
- Only works with Python 3.9 or higher

## Usage

### Installation

- You have to register your VW ID at [MyVolkswagen](https://www.volkswagen.de/de/besitzer-und-nutzer/myvolkswagen.html) and have a valid WE Connect ID subscription

- You need Python to connect to the Api. You can have a look [here](https://raspberrytips.com/install-latest-python-raspberry-pi/) on how to install it. Short it works like this, but normally you should already have python2 and/or python3 installed by default, so you normally don't need to install it:

```
cd ~
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.15/Python-3.9.15.tgz
tar -zxvf Python-3.9.15.tgz
cd Python-3.9.15
./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make altinstall
```

- To use this module, clone this repository to your __modules__ folder of your MagicMirror:

```
cd ~/MagicMirror/modules
git clone https://github.com/NikolasRupp/MMM-weconnectid-alt.git
```

- Now just add the module to your config.js file ([config entries](#configuration)).

### Configuration

The module needs the default configuration block in your config.js to work.

```javascript
{
  module: 'MMM-weconnectid',
  position: "top_left",
  config: {
    username: "",
    password: "",
    vin: "",
    fields: '{"SOC":"remainingSoC","RANGE":"remainingKm","CLIMATE":"climatisation","ODOMETER":"odometer","LOADING TIME":"remainingTime","TARGET SOC":"targetSoC","LOADING POWER":"chargePower","KMPH":"chargekmph"}',
    fields_charging : ["LOADING TIME","TARGET SOC","LOADING POWER","KMPH"],
    number: 4,
    python: "python3",
    maxHeight: "300px",
    maxWidth: "800px",
    remainingSOCyellow: 70,
    remainingSOCred: 20,
    barstyle: "fluent",
    updateFrequency: 600000,
    timestamp: true,
  }
},
```
